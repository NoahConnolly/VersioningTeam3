Over the summer, I did research with CyberWater with Dr. Lin, did the TechPoint S.O.S. Challenge, received a
$500 stipend for that, and I finnally quit my job at Dollar General. I'm very proud of the latter. I hate
that place. I also fumbled around with some different tools, configured a Raspberry Pi to run my own website
on the Dark Web (nothing illegal, just a lot of CSS magic [no JavaScript]). I also built my own desk light
from a broken nightlight that sits on the bottomside of my desk so I can shine it on my keyboard at night without
shining the light in my eyes. I also rescued a stray cat. His name is Pesto. He's small and orange and he loves to
lick hands :)

My summer was very lowkey due to the Coronavirus. I started back working at the rec-center once we opened back in July because
covid dismantled the couple of internship interviews I was slated for unfortunately. Other than that I spent most of my time hanging out
with my roommates, playing various videogames, and continuing work on my personal website/resume site. Overall pretty uneventful.
